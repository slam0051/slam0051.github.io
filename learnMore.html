            <h1>What is Sustainability?</h1>
            <p>Sustainability means using resources in a way that doesn't harm the planet or use up everything, so future generations can also have what they need.</p>
            <p>It focuses on three main areas:</p>
            <p>1. Environmental Sustainability: Protecting nature by conserving resources, reducing pollution, and taking care of ecosystems.</p>
            <p>2. Economic Sustainability: Growing the economy in ways that don't damage the environment, ensuring that resources are available for the future.</p>
            <p>3. Social Sustainability: Making sure everyone has what they need to live well, like food, water, and healthcare, and promoting fairness and equality.</p>
            <p> In simpler terms, sustainability is about living in a way that is good for people and the planet, both now and in the future.</p>
